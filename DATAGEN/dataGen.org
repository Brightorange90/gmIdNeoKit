* General
** Purpose
Guideline for detail usage of the files included
** Desired Users
1. Familiar with Cadence Virtuoso usage
2. Familiar with Spice/Spectre netlist creation & modification
* Steps
** Preparation
*** Generate the reference netlist
**** Build the schematic as shown in techChar_nmos2v_full.png
[[file:references/techChar_nmos2v_full.png]]
**** Generate the netlist as reference from ADE of Virtuoso
1. What you get should be similar to the modified netlist techChar_nmos2v.scs
2. The netlist you generated through config_xxx_spectre.m file should be similar to the one generated by ADE. Pay attention to the following parts
   - Path to model files included for simulation
   - Corner settings
   - MOS transistors width, number of fingers, and multipliers
